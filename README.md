📊 Banking BI & Analytics Project
📌 Overview

This project applies Business Intelligence (BI) and data analytics to optimize decision-making for a banking institution. It analyzes customer behavior, marketing performance, and credit risk indicators to identify growth opportunities and reduce default risks. The insights demonstrate how data-driven strategies significantly improve efficiency and profitability.

🎯 Objectives
